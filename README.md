Project Title:
Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking with GPS Tracking System

üìå Overview:
Drunk driving is one of the major causes of road accidents worldwide. To mitigate this issue, the Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking with GPS Tracking System is designed to detect alcohol consumption in drivers and prevent vehicle operation. This system also tracks the real-time location of the vehicle and sends alerts to authorized persons if alcohol is detected.

The system uses an MQ3 alcohol sensor to detect the presence of alcohol in the driver's breath. If alcohol concentration exceeds a safe limit, the engine ignition system is disabled using a relay module, thereby preventing the driver from starting the vehicle. Simultaneously, a GPS module tracks the vehicle‚Äôs location, and a GSM module sends an SMS alert containing the real-time coordinates to predefined emergency contacts or authorities.

üéØ Objectives:
Prevent drunk driving by locking the vehicle's engine if alcohol is detected.

Provide real-time GPS tracking of the vehicle.

Alert family members or law enforcement through SMS when alcohol is detected.

Enhance vehicle and passenger safety with an intelligent and automated system.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features:
Alcohol Detection: Uses MQ3 sensor to detect alcohol vapors in breath.

Automatic Engine Locking: Relay cuts off engine ignition when alcohol is detected.

GPS Tracking: Neo-6M GPS module provides accurate location data.

SMS Alerts: GSM module sends real-time SMS alerts with location.

LCD Display: Shows system status and alerts.

Optional Add-ons: Fingerprint authentication, mobile app control, voice alerts, accident detection, and cloud logging.

üß† Working Principle:
Driver breathes near the MQ3 sensor.

Sensor detects the alcohol level in the breath.

If alcohol is above the threshold:

Relay activates, cutting off power to the ignition system.

GSM module sends an SMS to a predefined number.

GPS module tracks location and shares coordinates.

If no alcohol is detected:

Vehicle starts normally.

üîã Power Supply:
Can be powered by the car battery (12V DC).

Backup battery recommended to power modules independently.

üßæ Applications:
Personal vehicles

School and college transport systems

Commercial transport and logistics

Emergency and government vehicles

‚úÖ Benefits:
Reduces drunk driving incidents and related accidents.

Promotes road safety.

Real-time vehicle monitoring and emergency alerts.

Can be integrated into smart vehicle systems and IoT platforms.
